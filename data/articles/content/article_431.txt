Our identification of the BUILT-IN BRANDS trend didn't come via a spontaneous midnight brainstorming session ;) Instead, as with all our trends, the process was rather more straightforward - and structured. That's because all the trends we spot and share are really newly-emerging directions of travel in one (or more) of our 16 mega-trends . These mega-trends are the big, slow-moving currents in the consumer arena and, taken together, they form the Trend Framework: our complete picture of consumerism today and where it's heading. Grab a glimpse of the Trend Framework below. Having a robust and comprehensive Trend Framework allows us to assess the implications of the hundreds, if not thousands, of innovations we receive from TW:IN (TrendWatching's global network of spotters) every day. Meaning we can keep spotting and sharing great trends.
