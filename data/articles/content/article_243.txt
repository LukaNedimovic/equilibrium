Just 24 hours after we reported on Barclays missing its own Apple Pay launch deadline , the bank finally flicked the switch and activated the service for the first time. Barclays was the last of the big four UK banks to adopt the service, to the disappointment of their customers, many of whom who took to Twitter over the past 9 months to vent their fury: @Barclays misses #applepay date again. Had enough of waiting, time to switch banks to one that's IN THE 21st CENTURY!!! &#x1f621;&#x1f621; - Patrick Sheppard (@dj_paddy_bhe) April 3, 2016 @Barclays if we missed our deadline for a service/payment you'd charge us. You've missed your deadline for #ApplePay ...Should we charge you? - Phillip Clark (@Djphillymix) April 3, 2016 @Barclays when will Apple Pay be up and running? It's honestly making me consider leaving #Barclays - Mr Mqueen (@mr_mqueen) April 4, 2016 Apple Pay goes live In a bland press statement , Ashok Vaswani, CEO of Barclays UK, said: "We are passionate about helping customers access services and carry out their day to day transactions in the way that suits them." "As part of this, we have developed a range of digital innovations that allow people to choose how, when and where they bank and make payments. Adding to the existing choice, from today both Barclays debit and Barclaycard credit card customers can use Apple Pay to make payments with their Apple device across the UK." There has been no mention of why it took the bank so long to adopt the technology or whether Barclays will roll out Google's long-awaited Android Pay system, due in the UK in a matter of months.
