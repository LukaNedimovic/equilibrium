Data science is a growing career field that pays well. If you are interested in programming, math, and/or statistics, this career could be perfect for you. There are, however, three different data science roles for you to consider. Springboard explains that data science teams solve data problems, such as building a statistical model to predict sales: Data scientists are the bridge between the programming and implementation of data science, the theory of data science, and the business implications of data. data engineers[ ...] rely mostly on their software engineering experience to handle large amounts of data at scale. These are versatile generalists who use computer science to help process large datasets. They typically focus on coding, cleaning up data sets, and implementing requests that come from data scientists. Lastly, there are data analysts who look through the data and provide reports and visualizations to explain what insights the data is hiding. All three are interesting careers that require some math know-how, particularly understanding algorithms, in addition to software engineering and communication skills, depending on the role. The graphic below sums up the data science career field, but you can also head to Springboard to get a free 70-page guide to these careers if you're interested in learning more.
