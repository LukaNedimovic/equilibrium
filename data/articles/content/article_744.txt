Following several high profile launches, including Lloyd's video services for mortgages , the researchers spoke to banking professionals in 24 countries, asking them what role face-to-face video is playing the digital transformation of banks . They found that a quarter of those surveyed currently have or are piloting a video banking service, with a further 24% planning to begin such a scheme within the next 12 months. With customer satisfaction and building a reputation for innovation cited as motivators, there is agreement that most banks expect to offer video going forward. However, some banks will implement this as a from-home service via mobile or desktop, while others suggest they will deliver this service through ATMs or even in-branch. When it comes to services, more than half (60%) of banks agree that private banking, wealth management, mortgage and loan services are best suited for video banking formats. Vincent Bastid, CEO of Efma, commented: "The findings show that there is a strong appetite for video-powered banking worldwide, and we firmly believe in the power of the technology to maintain and improve the personal connection between the customer and the bank." As these products move to market, security, compliance, cost, and customer preparedness, have all been raised as challenges.
