Every day, hundreds of thousands of developers send millions of requests to Google APIs, from Maps to YouTube . Thousands of developers visit the console for credentials, quota, and more -- and we want to give them a better and more streamlined experience. Starting today, we'll gradually roll out the API Console at console.developers.google.com focusing entirely on your Google API experience. There, you'll find a significantly cleaner, simpler interface: instead of 20+ sections in the navigation bar, you'll see API Manager, Billing and Permissions only: Figure 1: API Console home page Figure 2: Navigation section for API Console console.cloud.google.com will remain unchanged. It'll point to Cloud console, which includes the entire suite of Google Cloud Platform services, just like before. And while the two are different destinations, your underlying resources remain the same: projects created on Cloud Console will still be accessible on API Console, and vice versa. The purpose of the new API Console is to let you complete common API-related tasks quickly. For instance, we know that once you enable an API in a new project, the next step is usually to create credentials. That's why we've built the credentials wizard: a quick and convenient way for you to figure out what kind of credentials you need, and add them right after enabling an API: Figure 3: After enabling an API, you're prompted to go to Credentials Figure 4: Credentials wizard Over time, we will continue to tailor the API Console experience for the many developers out there who use Google's APIs. So if you're one of these users, we encourage you to try out API Console and use the feedback button to let us know what you think!
