Bug Type 3: Missing Specifications Description The specification was missing, therefore the implementation is missing. Simply put, these are the scenarios you never imagined when designing your product. They are otherwise referred to as the "unknown" type. Their impact is unpredictable and can range from embarrassing to catastrophic . Common Causes Insufficient Research You've probably heard the phrase that that when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me. Assumed value is no different and can come with tricky nuances. When these are not researched, an unknown bug hatches! Ignorance Someone realizes the "implementation is wrong" at release time, even though the expected behavior was not specified! Sound familiar? These bugs come into existence due to the lack 0f specifications. Highest Impact Quality Function Behaviour Driven Development Huh? Again? Yep! The deliberate discovery stage of BDD is a great way to use the wisdom of crowds and identify unknowns. The discovery stage is not unidirectional but rather, it's iterative. It is intended to create questions as well as answers. Some of these questions require further research to feed back to the team. This cycle of interactions is an excellent way to deliberately discover unknown specifications. Summing it up For the foreseeable future, as long as we create software, we will inadvertently create some bugs. But just my old man can share with me a proven technique to save my night's sleep, so we can learn some great techniques to save us a lifetime of fighting bugs. The trick is not to think about how to fight them, it is to understand how to never invite them into a fight in the first place.
