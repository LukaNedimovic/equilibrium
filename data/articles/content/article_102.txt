is the name for a light brown candy made from butter, sugar, and milk or cream, but it is also used to refer to sugar that is cooked until it is burnt that is used as a flavor or color, or, most simply, as a light brown color. Like so many of our dessert words, it came to English from French. The French word came through Spanish from the Portuguese word caramelo , which meant "icicle" and derived from the Latin word for "small reed" or "tube." Caramel can be correctly pronounced with two syllables (KAR-mel) or three syllables (KAHR-uh-mel, KAIR-uh-mel).
