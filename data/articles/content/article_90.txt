Posted by Josh Gordon , Developer Advocate To help you get started building applications with machine learning, we're excited to launch a new developer show, Machine Learning: Recipes for New Developers. In the first few episodes, we'll teach you the ropes of machine learning without requiring any major prerequisites (like calculus). As the series progresses, we'll walk you from "Hello World" to solving some real world problems. Episodes will generally publish bi-weekly, and be only about 5-10 minutes in length to keep the material lightweight. Occasionally, we'll have guests on the show who work with machine learning on different teams around Google. Ep #1: Hello World. Six lines of Python is all it takes to write your first machine learning program! In this episode, we'll briefly introduce what machine learning is and why it's important. Then, we'll follow a recipe for supervised learning (a technique to create a classifier from examples) and code it up. Also: Coffee with a Googler came to NYC! Laurence and Josh talk about the importance of machine learning for developers, and reducing barriers to machine learning education. Check out the video!
