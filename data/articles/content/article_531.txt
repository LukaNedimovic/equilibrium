Today, Google reiterated its commitment to the security needs of its enterprise customers with the addition of two new certificates to Google Cloud Platform : ISO27017 for cloud security and ISO27018 for privacy. We also renewed our ISO27001 certificate for the fourth year in a row. Google Cloud Platform services covered by these ISO certifications now include Cloud Dataflow , Cloud Bigtable , Container Engine , Cloud Dataproc and Container Registry . These join Compute Engine , App Engine , Cloud SQL , Cloud Storage , Cloud Datastore , BigQuery and Genomics on the list of services that will be regularly audited for these certificates. Certifications such as these provide independent third-party validations of our ongoing commitment to world-class security and privacy, while also helping our customers with their own compliance efforts. Google has spent years building one of the world's most advanced infrastructures, and as we make it available to enterprises worldwide, we want to offer more transparency on how we protect their data in the cloud.
