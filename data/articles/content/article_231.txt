If you're still using a physical Google Wallet card to make transactions when you're out and about, you should probably start looking for a new way to pay. Google has just announced that it will stop supporting physical Google Wallet cards on Thursday, June 30th. The company will stop supporting the cards so they can more easily focus on the new Google Wallet app, which launched last fall . You'll be able to make purchases with your Wallet card until June 30th. Once May 1st rolls around, you won't be able to add any money to your Wallet balance from a debit card or bank account. You can still receive money from others after that point. And if you happen to have money in your Wallet balance after May 1st, you can keep it there, send it to others, or cash it out anytime for free. Google also mentions that both American Express and Simple offer debit accounts with similar features. Plus, if you switch to one of these new accounts, you'll be able to score some extra bonuses.
