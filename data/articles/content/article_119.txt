Email's great, but sometimes you just wanna hit the eject button. Like those heated threads at work, when everyone's wrong except you (obviously). Or those times when someone's seeking group approval, but your opinion is the only one that matters (amirite?). Or maybe you just nailed it, and there's nothing more to say (bam). Today, Gmail is making it easier to have the last word on any email with Mic Drop. Simply reply to any email using the new 'Send + Mic Drop' button. Everyone will get your message, but that's the last you'll ever hear about it. Yes, even if folks try to respond, you won't see it. When you drop the mic, your email will also include an explanatory image--just to help set expectations. Friends and family have been testing Gmail Mic Drop for months, and the response so far has been awesome: "Sending email is so much easier when you don't have to worry about people responding!" "Mic Drop is a huge improvement over Mute! I can finally let everyone know I'm just not interested." "My team solves problems so much faster with Mic Drop. In fact, we stopped talking to each other entirely!" Gmail Mic Drop is launching first on the web, but mobile updates are on the way. So stay tuned, and stay saucy.
