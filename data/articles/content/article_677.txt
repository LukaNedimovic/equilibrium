TechCrunch is pleased to announce the 20 startups selected to participate in the Disrupt NY 2016 Startup Battlefield. Over the next two days, these companies will compete on tech's biggest stage for $50,000 and the Disrupt Cup. Selection for the Battlefield is incredibly competitive: The startups onstage represent just under 4 percent of those that applied. Startup Battlefield serves to showcase the most promising early-stage and, dare we say, disruptive startups in the industry. This batch has a little something for everyone. These companies bring more interaction to online gaming, enable athletes to train harder, produce clean air indoors, provide credit for the unbanked, keep bicyclists safe on the roads and kids safe online. They make finding a job and even an apartment more straightforward. Over the past month, these startups have been working tirelessly to prepare to launch, rushing to finalize designs, and produce that final prototype. They spent time with TechCrunch staff to hone their pitches to a crisp six minutes. Finalists from the first two days will present once more on Wednesday. All this work pays off when each startup faces a rigorous live Q/A session from a lineup of judges from the likes of First Round Capital, KPCB, Greycroft, NEA, General Catalyst, Sequoia and others. The Startup Battlefield hub page contains all the details of the event, including the schedule, bios of the judges and more details on the companies. The pitches start live at 2:30 p.m. ET today and 3:05 p.m. ET tomorrow. Battlefield companies will also be showcasing in the Startup Alley both days of the conference. Stop by and see what all the fuss is about. Session 2 - 3:55 p.m. Wild Card* Session 4 - 4:30 p.m.
