You aren't about to buy a ready-made AAduino, but you don't have to. Kanflo has posted instructions and schematics both on his own site and on GitHub , so you can replicate his invention yourself. This is mainly useful if you're building an extra-compact gadget (Kanflo needed this for a radio node, for instance), but it shows that even daunting size requirements can be solved with a little ingenuity.
