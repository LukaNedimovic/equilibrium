You are here We spent a lot of time thinking about how to highlight the organizations in our Marketplace that are actively contributing to the project. There are some awesome Drupal shops and hosting partners out there that are making a huge difference. Service providers that you see in the marketplace are only part of the story of how Drupal is built. Last week, we launched a new list of organizations on Drupal.org that shows every profile that has been created for an organization. This includes companies, universities, nonprofits, governments and more. These are our customers and community organizations that use Drupal to power their web experiences. By giving their developers time to contribute code back to the community, they are helping to ensure the project gets the best ideas from the most diverse group of makers and builders. While the new view shows all organizations, I was able to pull out the top 10 customers-organizations that do not sell Drupal services or hosting-and community organizations (e.g. community from a region). So who have been most active among this type of organization over the last 90 days? Examiner.com - 56 issue credits Pfizer - 29 issue credits Freitag - 19 issue credits Drupal Ukraine Community - 17 issue credits ARTE G.E.I.E. - 15 issue credits University of Waterloo - 13 issue credits Card.com - 13 issue credits Gemeente Venlo - 11 issue credits Dennis Publishing - 9 issue credits (and they are Drupal Association members to boot!) NBCUniversal - 7 issue credits Check out the full list of every organization with a profile on Drupal.org. Keep in mind, we can only track issue credits when issue participants credit an organization and when maintainers award those credits. Only organizations with a profile on Drupal.org can be credited. Confirmed users can add new organizations . We are all excited to see where this takes us and what we can learn about how organizations that use Drupal are giving back. If your company or organization wants to give back in ways other than contributing in the code and issue queues, consider becoming an organization member , joining one of our supporter programs , or sponsoring a DrupalCon or camp.
