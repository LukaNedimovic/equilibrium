The public cloud is a network, not just a collection of data centers. Our global network has allowed us to build products that billions of users around the world can depend on. Whether you're in Taipei or Tijuana, you can get Gmail, Search, Maps or your Google Cloud Platform services with Google speed and reliability. We're adding to this global network for Cloud Platform customers by expanding our roster of existing Cloud Platform regions with two more - both operational later this year: US Western region in Oregon East Asia region in (Tokyo) Japan As always, each region has multiple availability zones, so that we can offer high-availability computing to our customers in each locale. These are the first two of more than 10 additional GCP regions we'll be adding to our network through 2017. This follows the opening last year of a US east coast region in South Carolina for all major GCP services. We're opening these new regions to help Cloud Platform customers deploy services and applications nearer to their own customers, for lower latency and greater responsiveness. With these new regions, even more applications become candidates to run on Cloud Platform, and get the benefits of Google-level scale and industry leading price/performance . The Japan region will be in beta for at least a month. You can fill out this survey to sign up for the beta, and we'll notify you as soon as it's ready. If you're interested in Oregon, please fill out this survey to be notified. To learn how to make the best use of Cloud Platform regions for your application needs, please see the Geography and Regions details page. - Posted by Varun Sakalkar, Product Manager
