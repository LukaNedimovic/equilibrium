Probably the biggest event on the Android calendar is Google I/O , and it's just around the corner, running from the 18th of May to the 20th. This year's event will be held at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View , where the first Google I/O event took place in 2008, rather than the usual Moscone Center in San Francisco. There has been much speculation as to what this will look like. This is, after all, relatively new territory for the company. But thanks to a custom map released by Google, and built using Google Maps's MyMaps feature, we now have an idea. Google plans to convert a large section of the car park into a set of ten stages , each named after a particular constellation such as Virgo, Ursa Minor, and Cassiopeia. The stages will be grouped into four different quadrants. In addition to the ten stages, there will also be a code lab and thirteen demo zones. As you might expect, the more prestigious keynote speeches and events will be taking place in the amphitheater proper. With the event taking place far away from San Francisco's excellent public transport system, the question remains as to how attendees will get to and from the event. That's especially relevant seeing as the majority of the parking spaces will used to host the conference. This, I imagine, will become clearer closer to the date.
