We're happy to announce that starting today the Gentle Notifications lab is graduating to become a fully supported feature. You can now continue working in other tabs uninterrupted without losing track of your next meeting. Event notifications in browsers which support Web Notifications (like Google Chrome) will allow you to use native browser notifications instead of interruptive alerts. Get notifications using your browser's native notification. This new feature is opt-in and automatically activated for existing lab users. In order to opt-in, simply enable browser notifications from the settings menu in Google Calendar.
