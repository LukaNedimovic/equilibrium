Yakuza tattoos are generally reserved for the most hardened of clan members, but for architect Vincent Coste , they go way beyond a life of crime. Ko√Ø, a Japanese restaurant in Aix-en-Provence, France, pacifies all notions associated with the underground syndicate via an elaborately designed interior that feels contemporary and inviting. Graphically created by surface pattern designer Claire Leina , Yakuza motifs in black and white adorn entranceway walls, floors, ceilings and bathrooms, used more sparingly in dining areas and a patio area out back. Seated sections look pale by comparison, though metallic red chairs, timber flooring, warm mood lighting and concrete countertops achieve a nice coherence nonetheless.
