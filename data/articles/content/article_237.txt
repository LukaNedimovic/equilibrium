Digital-only lender Atom Bank is launching today as the latest challenger seeking to shake up Britain's financial services market and to wrest customers away from the big banks. Atom will initially offer services only via iPhone and iPad apps , and said it plans to launch for mobile customers with the Android operating system in the near future. The first product to individual customers is a one-year fixed-term savings account, which offers depositors 2pc interest - a rate which is very close to being the best on the market, indicating the bank's desire to raise deposits quickly. Small business customers will also be offered secured loans which will be sold via intermediaries such as mortgage brokers. The bank said it plans to offer more products soon, including a current account. "By the end of 2016, customers will have access to fixed savings, current accounts, overdrafts, debit and credit cards, instant access savings and residential mortgages, all serviced via the app," it said.
