As you step out of the elevator on the fourth floor of an otherwise ordinary looking industrial office building in Manhattan's tony Chelsea neighborhood, you may think you've stumbled across a secret Starbucks location known only to the cool kids. Dozens of young faces are lit up by laptops, sitting in small clusters around cafe tables. In the background, an inspirational banner reads, "Can I kick it? Yes you can." A barista in the corner mans the coffee machines. Bloody Mary drinks are lined up in rows further down the counter, waiting for the Friday morning rush. Welcome to the New York headquarters for WeWork, a startup that has rocketed to a reported $16 billion valuation by designing fun and flexible coworking spaces for other startups. WeWork has emerged as the Willy Wonka for crafting modern startup office spaces -- and this building is its chocolate factory. The company's bearded cofounder Miguel McKelvey lumbers through the halls, towering above all at 6'8'', pointing out WeWork's latest design experiments, any of which may one day find their way into other offices around the world.
