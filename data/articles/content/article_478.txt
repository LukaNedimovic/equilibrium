If you like the tips and ideas I share here (and I sure hope you do), I've got some good news for you. I'm changing what has forever been the "Mountain Goat Software Monthly Newsletter" to be just quite simply weekly tips from me. Face it: Mountain Goat Software isn't exactly awash with "news" so when it came time to write a "monthly newsletter," I never quite knew what to put in there. So, I would write something that was exactly the same as a blog post. And because newsletter content was about the same as blog content, we'd re-publish the newsletter on the blog. Sure, we'd put a little news in the newsletter, but it was mostly sales stuff like a list of classes or cities I was teaching in. You probably didn't want that. So, there's more good news: we're taking the list of courses out of what will now be a weekly tip. You know I teach classes. You know how to figure out where I teach them. Oh sure, the old newsletter occasionally contained news such as I would be speaking at a conference, or that I was working on a new book or video course. And the weekly tips email will still be the first place to read that type of news. So, if you're interested in tips on how to succeed with agile, sign up now . You'll get a new tip from me each Thursday. And this will be your only way to get those tips. I'm saving my best tips for these emails. Tips will not be reposted on the blog as in the past. And, of course, I promise we won't spam you or give your info to anyone else.
