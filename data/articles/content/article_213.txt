Whether you like watching Despicable Me on Google Play Movies & TV, streaming "Sorry" on Play Music, battling your friend in Clash Royale on Play Games or reading John Grisham's latest on Play Books, Google Play is your home for the best apps, games and digital entertainment. Since launching Google Play four years ago, we've always had dedicated apps in addition to the Google Play store. Today, all our icons are getting an update to provide a consistent look across the entire family of Play apps. You'll start to see the new Google Play icons across devices and online in the coming weeks. We hope you'll continue enjoying the Play family of products-now with a new look.
