An internet connection isn't always easy to come by, but that shouldn't stop your employees from completing their work. That's why we give Google Apps admins the option of allowing their users to enable offline access to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files. Once an individual user has enabled offline access in Google Drive, a subset of their Docs, Sheets, and Slides files are synced to their computer or device. The specific files synced are based on certain criteria, primarily recency. With this launch, we'll allow end users to choose the specific files they want to make available for offline access when they're working in a Chrome browser on their desktop computer. This will make it easy for individuals to work anywhere, anytime, even when they don't have an internet connection. To make a file available for offline access, a user simply needs to visit the Docs, Sheets, or Slides home screen and toggle the Available offline switch in a file's overflow menu to ON. Please note that this feature will only be available to users working in a Chrome browser on desktop and whose admins have allowed them to enable offline access in Drive.
