To mark Internet of Things Day (IoT Day), RS Components takes a look at how it envisions IoT will change people's lives for the better. IoT Day has been around since 2011 as a worldwide event bringing together makers, entrepreneurs, industry leaders, and citizens to discuss, design and develop the emerging IoT, but even in the five years since, an awful lot has changed in the industry. One look at predictions made about where the technology is going and what sums of money will be generated or exchanged - either from a consumer standpoint or industrial standpoint - is enough to make your head spin. Financial benefits For example, a report issued last year states that it's likely that, by 2020, companies not taking advantage of the industrial side of IoT could be missing out on a market worth approximately $14.3trn. Equally large was another estimate which expects there to be 38.5bn IoT devices across the globe in just four years' time. So, to that end, electrical component manufacturer, RS Solutions, offers its own infographical insight into how it sees IoT entering into every facet of daily life from the moment you wake up, to when you go to sleep.
