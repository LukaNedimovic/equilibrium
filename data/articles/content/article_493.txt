Google Consumer Surveys has launched an API, built on Google Cloud Platform, that lets your app users create and integrate surveys. We've spoken to research and non-research companies who are really interested in bringing the power of our Consumer Surveys tool into their own applications, and with this launch it's finally possible. We imagine many different use-cases to tap into the millions of respondents our platform can connect you with, across a dozen or more markets around the world. Leading up to our launch we worked closely with a handful of trusted testers who provided valuable feedback. These have included proprietary solutions to manage studies conducted on the Google Consumer Surveys platform ( Kantar ), predictive analytics solutions ( Predictvia ), and solutions that help customers visualize their Google Consumer Surveys data ( MarketSight ). We look forward to working with developers to build unique solutions that empower individuals and businesses to make better data driven decisions. If you're an existing Google Consumer Surveys Enterprise customer on an invoicing contract, you can start using the API immediately. If you're not an Enterprise customer but are interested in accessing the API, you can get in touch with us at gcs-api@google.com . You can read more about our API on our API documentation site .
