Google has today announced a new keyboard for iOS devices that directly integrates search functions. Called Gboard, the keyboard features a button on the upper left that lets you perform web searches, look for images or GIFs, or even search for emoji without ever leaving the keyboard. Results from web searches can be instantly pasted into a text box. The Verge's Casey Newton exclusively reported that Google was working on such a keyboard for the iPhone back in March. In addition to the search functionality, Gboard also offers word tracing. Overall, it appears to be a blend of Google's best features from its keyboard and Google Now On Tap service on Android, but brought to the iPhone. You can download the new keyboard from the App Store now.
