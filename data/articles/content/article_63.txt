techcrunch.com / Romain Dillet / March 29, 2016 Meet Stratumn , a Paris-based startup that wants to create a platform-as-a-service for developers interested in the blockchain. With Stratumn, you can build, deploy and run applications on the company's platform, and these applications can communicate with the bitcoin blockchain. It's like Heroku, but for blockchain developers. The company just raised $670,000 (€600,000) from Otium Venture and business angels, such as Ledger Wallet CEO Eric Larchevêque . At heart, the bitcoin blockchain is a distributed database that registers all bitcoin transactions with a timestamp. Many have taken advantage of the blockchain to build applications that were unrelated to bitcoin transactions. For instance, Stampery wants to replace notaries with the bitcoin blockchain. The service can issue legally binding proofs for all your sensitive documents, and these proofs live on the blockchain. But Stratumn is taking this idea one step further and saying that other startups like Stampery are going to appear. Instead of having to redo the hard work from scratch, Stratumn lets your application talk with the blockchain without any effort from your side. READ MORE
