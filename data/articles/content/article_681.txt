Siri co-founder and CEO Dag Kittlaus has been quietly working on a much-anticipated voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning and integrations with third-party services. This product is called Viv and, in a world first, Kittlaus just gave us a demo at TechCrunch Disrupt NY that shows off the power of what they've built with Viv. Like with Siri, Viv wants to build a conversational and smart layer that lets you interact with various services. But Viv is taking everything one step further. It's more personal, it's more ubiquitous. More importantly, there's a developer platform to add more services. A demo is worth a thousand words. Without further ado, meet Viv: Head over to TechCrunch.com for our full coverage of Kittlaus' interview and learn more about the vision behind Viv.
