Twitter has discontinued Magic Recs, its bot that alerted users via DM about trending posts and popular accounts. In a written statement to TechCrunch , a Twitter spokesperson had the following to say about the company's new direction with regard to bots: @MagicRecs is no longer regularly sending recommendations through Direct Message. Recommendations that were previously shared via Direct Message are now delivered via push notification. Magic Recs (which Twitter always tagged as an 'experiment') was one of the few useful bots around, but required you to follow the account (you know, DMs and all that). It also didn't have many followers: 112,000. Not that push notifications are much better than a DM, but it's probably just Twitter streamlining its efforts. The account is still active, but there's no reason to follow it now. Twitter quietly retires Magic Recs, a DM bot that recommended viral accounts and Tweets on TechCrunch TNW's West Coast writer in the PNW (Portland, Oregon). Nate loves amplifying developers, and codes in Swift when he's not writing. If you need to get in touch, Twitter or email are your best bets.
