If you listen to as many podcasts as I do, you must be familiar with Prosper thanks to its many ads across different podcast networks. The company's business model is to let peers lend money to each other, without any banks or institutions standing in the middle, or so I understand. But Prosper isn't alone in this domain, there's Lending Club and Funding Circle as well. The problem with all of these sites is that they don't offer a mobile application, which is a big miss in our modern day. What good is an awesome portfolio if you can't see its performance from your phone while walking your dog in your suburban neighborhood? Well, LendingRobot is here to solve that problem. The company can monitor portfolios across the three aforementioned peer-to-peer lending marketplaces or also act as a robo-advisor and automate your investments. The biggest benefit of its Android app though is that it works whether you have a LendingRobot account or not and you just want to log in to your Prosper, Lending Club, or Funding Circle accounts. It has a unified view to see your overall portfolio performance, support for multiple accounts across each marketplace, a health graph with current and projected returns, average interest rates, and more financial data that any lender will surely appreciate. LendingRobot is free to download in the Play Store, but obviously it won't be of much use to you if you don't have enough money to lend.
