Ten years ago, most websites in the banking industry were pretty ugly. Functional? Yes. Attractive? No. How times have changed since. There are still plenty of really homely websites out there, and some are downright hideous. But the banking industry has come a long way - both in terms of its visual aesthetic and the user experience. Here's a collection of websites that caught The Financial Brand's eye in the last few months. What stands out to us? All the junk and noise that plagued earlier versions of websites is gone. The navigation is simpler, and the amount of information presented on the home page has been significantly pared back. Generally, most of the sites featured here have fewer than 150 words total on the page (including navigation links). They rely heavily on evocative imagery to create a visually striking impression. All are responsive, and a few even incorporate parallax scrolling. Perhaps the biggest trend emerging is that the design style is inspired from - if not entirely driven by - the mobile browsing experience. You can click on any image to enlarge it. You can also click on the financial institution's name to visit their website. Load them up and play with them. Have fun!
